/* In ordinary Prolog, each variable is either unbound, or bound to
 * some expression. A bound variable cannot be "reassigned", but can
 * become unbound only in backtracking. The clpfd extension allows
 * some variables to be internally marked as having integer domains.
 * Instead of being merely bound or unbound, each integer variable
 * carries a set of equality and inequality constraints. If these
 * constraints become contradictory, such as X #< 3 \/ X #> 10 for
 * some integer variable X, the execution fails and backtracks to
 * the most recent choice point.
 * 
 * Once you get accustomed to this mechanism, you can just use it
 * as routine and forget that it even existed. Predicates written in
 * the CLP formalism just silently work better than ordinary Prolog
 * predicates, in that they terminate with solutions for some queries
 * that would make the ordinary predicates crash or fall into an
 * infinite loop.
 * 
 * Integer variables with arbitrary constraints can always be turned
 * back into ordinary Prolog variables with predicates indomain/1 and
 * labelling/2. These predicates bind one variable or a list of
 * variables to the values in their domain one value at the time.
